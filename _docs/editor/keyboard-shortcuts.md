You can perform many tasks in Nuclide from the keyboard. Below are the various keyboard shortcuts
available for the sets of functionality that Nuclide has to offer.

> Atom has many more keyboard shortcuts available above and beyond what Nuclide offers. To

## Symbols

Here is a legend of symbols that are associated with the keys shown in the keybindings.

| Key | Symbol |
| ----|--------|
| `Alt` or `Option` on macOS | `⌥` |
| `Cmd` on macOS | `⌘` |
| `Ctrl` | `^` |

If you see a comma (`,`) in a key sequence that means *then*, as in "press this sequence, then press that
