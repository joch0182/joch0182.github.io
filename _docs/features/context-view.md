## Toggling

To toggle the Context View panel, you can:

1. Press `Cmd-I` (`Ctrl-I` on Linux).
2. Go to the `Nuclide | Context View | Toggle` menu.
3. Click on the **Toggle Context View** [button](/docs/features/toolbar/#buttons) on the [Nuclide toolbar](/docs/features/toolbar).

## Definition Preview

When you click on a symbol in the [Editing Area](/docs/editor/basics/#editing-area), the symbol's definition will be highlighted in the Context View panel.

Clicking on the **Open in main editor** button at the bottom of the Context View panel moves the cursor to that definition be it in the current file or a different one.

> Context View currently supports [Hack](/docs/languages/hack), [Python](/docs/languages/python), [Objective-C](/docs/languages/objective-c/), [C++](/docs/languages/cpp), and [GraphQL](/docs/languages/graphql) files.
